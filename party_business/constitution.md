# Objectives

The NVB has the following core objectives:

* To improve the functioning of the Parliament by enabling **specialisation and trade** of parliamentary power.
* To encourage **cycles of conjecture and criticism** around legislation and policy.
* To act as a catalyst in **the creation of new policy options** which are the key to solving existing problems.
* To assist minor and micro parties to tackle the issues they really care about in an open, welcoming, transparent, and non-discriminatory manner.
* To endorse candidates chosen from our core member base during Federal Elections.
* To remain impartial on all legislative changes and provide participants total autonomy.

# Name

The name of the party is `Neutral Voting Bloc`, also known as `The Neutral Voting Bloc`. The abbreviation is `(the) NVB` or `(the) NVBloc`.

# This Document

## Lifetime

This constitution is valid until Jan 1 2021 by which time a new constitution must be drafted, criticised, redrafted, (etc), and accepted by a 75% majority of the party.

## Amendments

Amendments can be proposed at any time via a pull request and announcement (via BlocVoting). There will be a 3 month voting period using the BlocVoting protocol.

# Voting

The NVB shall use the BlocVoting protocol to decide internal and external resolutions.

External resolutions are things like bills that come before the Senate, and will be voted on by NVB participants. The core administration is responsible for the creation of such resolutions, and maintaining them. The maximum time period for voting shall be allocated (such that the ballot ends a few hours before the actual vote in whichever house is concerned). These resolutions are able to be voted on by all members.

Internal resolutions are suggestions by participants for changes to the NVB's internal policy set or constitution. They should be formed as a pull request and the hash of the request will be used as an identifier. These resolutions are voted on by the core membership only.

# Membership

Core Membership is open to all Australians on the electoral roll who are not members of other parties. All eligible Australians are encouraged to become core members.

Core membership is priced via the pay-what-you-want model.

Members may only be expelled if they attempt to directly sabotage the party, and this is required to be approved by 95% of the core membership.

Non-party membership is also available to all voters in Australia, even if they are members of other political parties. This level of membership allows them to participate and vote on external resolutions.

# Definitions

* **Participants**: All core members, non-party members, and those political parties that have been allocated votes.
* **Core Members**: Members of the NVB in the eyes of the AEC.
* **Non-party Members**: Australian citizens on the electoral roll who voluntarily register to vote internally with the NVB.
* **Internal Resolutions**: Policy or Constitutional suggestions to be voted on for the NVB.
* **External Resolutions**: Ballots to be held that are triggered by a ballot in the host legislature (e.g. The Senate or Legislative Council).

# Notes

### Construction

This document is intended to be as clear and concise as possible.

### Interpretation

In the cases which this document is ambiguous, detailed consideration of the *meme* from which it was born is necessary to resolve the ambiguity. This necessitates close reading of *The Beginning of Infinity* as the NVB in and of itself is a product of the meme from which *The Beginning of Infinity* was also born.

### Philosophy

The philosophical background for these objectives is explored in great detail by David Deutsch in his 2011 book *The Beginning of Infinity*.

### Votes

Votes on amendments or replacements to this document must be for an exact git commit, referenced by hash.

### Democracy

As a general rule of thumb the word `democracy` is too general to use meaningfully in this document or other similar documents. This leads to miscommunication which impedes the replication and criticism of ideas. Its use is therefore discouraged.
